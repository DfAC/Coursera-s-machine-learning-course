# Coursera's machine learning course

THis is my code for the [Coursera's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/), following official code in Matlab and then completed in Python.
To kick off my python code I have forked [Lyn's one](https://github.com/linbug/Coursera-s-machine-learning-course)


[x] Exercise 1 (week 2)
[ ] Exercise 2 (week 3): still only Lyn's code
[ ]  Exercise 3

## notes

* for any matrix operation convert python pandas to numpy to avoid index based problems
